        <br>
        <p>hey there! I am Subasree, a data enthusiast finding comfort in making analysis, writing and presenting conclusions for optimal business solutions. I am a part time writer and full time student, never forget to mention Kaggle is my personal trainer, the foundation for any project I decide to work on.<br>
        <br>
        Why Data?
        <br>
        Good question. Answer is that I love questions, precisely, answering them. Interpretations, factual statements, they fascinate me and I discovered that working with data will enlighten my fantasy. Technical perspective, I feel working with tables, charts, documents and powerpoints are different fields present, with each project being the primary key, analyzing and making use of the right columns is prominent. Sometimes all the columns, sometimes few. 
        I am looking for opportunities to draw a positive correlation between data present and business solutions.</p>

        <p>--> Quantitative Evaluation: COVID 19 Cost Analysis
        <br>
        <br>
        Robust tree-based models, such as Regression Forest and Gradient models, were constructed in a quantitative assessment
        that emphasized on COVID-19 cost analysis. The models' goal was to help hospitals detect patients who are at risk of
        developing COVID-19, in order to reduce expensive emergency treatments. A model performance accuracy of 85.4% was
        attained by using Orange for data analysis and visualization, underscoring the significance of feature engineering in
        boosting model efficacy. In order to maximize the distribution of healthcare resources, a cost analysis was also carried
        out, taking into account a 50% threshold criterion. Long-term cost savings for healthcare systems can be achieved
        through the useful insights provided. Strong written and oral presentation skills were demonstrated by the ability to
        explain results efficiently with Microsoft PowerPoint.
